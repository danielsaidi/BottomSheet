BottomSheet supports `iOS 13` and `macOS 11`.



## Installation

BottomSheet can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/BottomSheet.git
```

or with CocoaPods:

## About this documentation

The online documentation is currently iOS only. To generate documentation for other platforms, open the package in Xcode, select a simulator then run `Product/Build Documentation`.

Note that DocC currently omits extensions, which means that some extensions are missing. Future versions will aim to improve this.
